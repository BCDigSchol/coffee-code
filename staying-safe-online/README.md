# How to Stay Safe and Secure Online

Feeling freaked out by all the cyber breaches lately? Want to plan an activist movement but want to stay safe? Or do you simply want to use online dating services without getting stalked? Join us in this workshop to learn about digital privacy. We’ll go over how to use tools to protect yourself online, as well as what to do if you’ve been hacked, harassed, or otherwise victimized online.

## Intro

We live so much of our lives online, and Google, Facebook, and Amazon already know everything about us, so should we even bother taking steps to safeguard our online privacy? YES. There are specific strategies you can use so that you can stay safe in the online spaces that are important to you.

First things first, what's your privacy personality? Take this [5-minute quiz](https://wnyc.typeform.com/to/CWAeSB) developed for [The Privacy Paradox](https://project.wnyc.org/privacy-paradox), a project of [Note to Self](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/notetoself), WNYC's tech show about being human.
