# How to Stay Safe and Secure Online

Feeling freaked out by all the cyber breaches lately? Want to plan an activist movement but want to stay safe? Or do you simply want to use online dating services without getting stalked? Join us in this workshop to learn about digital privacy. We’ll go over how to use tools to protect yourself online, as well as what to do if you’ve been hacked, harassed, or otherwise victimized on the web.

## Intro

We live so much of our lives online, and Google, Facebook, and Amazon already know everything about us, so should we even bother taking steps to safeguard our online privacy? And if you have nothing to hide, should you even be concerned about your privacy? YES. As [Glenn Greenwald said in coversation with the Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/20/glenn-greenwald-privacy_n_5509704.html):

> We all need places where we can go to explore without the judgmental eyes of other people being cast upon us, only in a realm where we’re not being watched can we really test the limits of who we want to be. It’s really in the private realm where dissent, creativity and personal exploration lie.

There are specific strategies you can use so that you can stay safe from prying eyes in the online spaces that are important to you.

First things first, what's your privacy personality? Take this [5-minute quiz](https://wnyc.typeform.com/to/CWAeSB) developed for [The Privacy Paradox](https://project.wnyc.org/privacy-paradox), a project of [Note to Self](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/notetoself), WNYC's tech show about being human.

## Scenarios and Strategies

### Scenario 1. Ad tracking, or big business is watching you :eyes:

Scenarios:
1. Describe a situation in which tracking is awesome because it creates a personalized online experience.
2. On the other hand, describe a situation in which tracking is awful.

Two strategies:
1. Browser or device security settings
2. Browser plugins (what's a plugin??)
3. Containerizing

### Scenario 2. You've been hacked! :scream:

* Phishing: it's not just about Nigerian princes  
* How to manage password fatigue  
* Why two-factor authentication matters  
* Why single sign-ons (SSOs) are actually terrible  

### Scenario 3. Online dating :love_letter:

* [Download](https://account.gotinder.com/data) your Tinder data.
* Text like no one's watching with [Signal](https://www.signal.org/download).
* [Combat](https://www.cybercivilrights.org) nonconsensual intimate images ("revenge porn").
* [Fight](https://nnedv.org/content/safety-net) online domestic violence.
* If you're in danger, [contact](https://www.bc.edu/offices/bcpd/contact-us.html) your local law enforcement agency.
* You can also [file](https://www.ic3.gov) an Internet Complaint Report if you're being stalked.
* If you are reluctant to contact law enforcement, [reach](https://www.womenslaw.org/) [out](https://www.cybercivilrights.org/ccri-crisis-helpline/) to other organizations for confidential advice.

### Scenario 4. Planning an activist movement :fist:

1. Location tracking
2. Secure messaging
3. Touch ID versus passcode

## Developing Your Privacy Plan

1. When have you experienced a feeling of "ick" or "oh, no" while online?
2. What balance would you like to strike between convenience versus privacy and security?
3. Based on what you've learned today, what tools or strategies would you like to adopt in order to combat the "ick" feeling?

## Implementing Your Privacy Plan

We're devoting the last 30 minutes of our time together to actually downloading and getting started with the tools that will be most helpful for you based on the priorities you identified when developing your privacy plan. Chelcie and Paige will be on hand to help if you have any questions.
