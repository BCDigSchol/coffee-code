# Introduction to Spatial Visualization & Analysis
This material was created for a [workshop](http://libcal.bc.edu/event/4540756) offered as part of the [Coffee & Code series](https://ds.bc.edu/events/) by the Digital Scholarship Group at Boston College Libraries.

## Learning Goals
This workshop will introduce participants to visualizing spatial data, creating maps with points and polygons, and performing basic data analysis with [Carto](https://carto.com/). Participants will get a hands-on experience using the Carto platform and will learn how to geocode point data using [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) by applying [GREL string functions]( https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/GREL-String-Functions).

## Workshop Overview
1. Discuss basic GIS terms and concepts

2. Review and download sample datasets
    - [Crime incident reports]()
    - [Census tracts for Suffolk County]()
    - [Police Districts in Boston, Massachusetts](/Carto-Workshop/Carto-2018-Fall/boston_police_stations.csv)
    - [Climate Data]()

3. Geocoding Location Data with [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) & [OpenCage Geocoder API](https://opencagedata.com/)
    - We will use this [sample dataset]()
    - Instructions for geocoding:
      - Add column by fetching URLs based on on (address) column
      - Give your new column a name
      - Change throttle delay to 1000 milliseconds
      - Use Expression:
`'https://api.opencagedata.com/geocode/v1/json?key=yourAPI&email=yourEmail&app=google-refine&q=' + escape(value, 'url')`
    - Extract the latitude/longitude
      - Select Edit Column ==> Add column based on this (JSON) column
      - Use expression `with(value.parseJson().results[0].geometry, pair, pair.lat +", " + pair.lng)`

4. Creating an interactive map
   - Layers (points and polygons)
   - Analysis (joining, buffer zone)
   - Widgets
   - Style
   - Publish, share, export your data and map
