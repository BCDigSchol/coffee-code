# Introduction to Spatial Visualization & Analysis with Carto
This [workshop](http://libcal.bc.edu/event/3914095?hs=a) is offered as part of [Boston DH Week 2018](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16LmLmmIEFCcamh7dwVX6N2FZ199VLPnt8VWMbKI1u_I/edit) and is co-taught by [Anna Kijas](https://ds.bc.edu/people/) (Boston College) and [Ece Turnator](https://libguides.mit.edu/directory/lirs#s-lg-box-wrapper-14366446) (MIT).

## Learning Goals
This workshop will introduce participants to visualizing spatial data, creating maps with points and polygons, and performing basic data analysis with [Carto](https://carto.com/). A brief overview of geocoding point data in [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) will be provided, as well as, examples and resources for georeferencing maps and adding basemaps.
