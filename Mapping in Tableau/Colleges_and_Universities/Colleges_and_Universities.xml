<abstract>The Colleges and Universities feature class is composed of all Post Secondary Education facilities as defined by the Integrated Post Secondary Education System (IPEDS, http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/), National Center for Education Statistics (NCES, https://nces.ed.gov/), US Department of Education for the 2014-2015 school year. Included are Doctoral/Research Universities, Masters Colleges and Universities, Baccalaureate Colleges, Associates Colleges, Theological seminaries, Medical Schools and other health care professions, Schools of engineering and technology, business and management, art, music, design, Law schools, Teachers colleges, Tribal colleges, and other specialized institutions. Overall, this data layer covers all 50 states, as well as Puerto Rico and other assorted U.S. territories. This feature class contains all MEDS/MEDS+ as approved by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) Team. Complete field and attribute information is available in the ”Entities and Attributes” metadata section. Geographical coverage is depicted in the thumbnail above and detailed in the "Place Keyword" section of the metadata. This feature class does not have a relationship class but is related to Supplemental Colleges. Colleges and Universities that are not included in the NCES IPEDS data are added to the Supplemental Colleges feature class when found.</abstract>
<purpose>This feature class/shapefile captures Colleges and Universities defined by the Integrated Post Secondary Education System (IPEDS) for the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation Level Data (HIFLD) database. (https://gii.dhs.gov/HIFLD)</purpose>

<attracc>
<attraccr>No formal attribute accuracy test was conducted. Data from the authoritative sources (as identified in other sections of this metadata) is assumed to be correct and accurate. See also “Overview Description” in the “Entities and Attributes” metadata section.</attraccr>
</attracc>
<logic>Data were extracted from sources (identified in the SOURCE field) and other open source websites to populate the attribute fields. For string and date data types, NOT AVAILABLE values denote missing data that was not present in the source data. For numeric data types, -999 denotes missing data that was not present in the source data. For fields sourced to NCES IPEDS, -2 indicates that a value for that record is 'Not applicable'. During quality control, attributes were checked to ensure that they fell within the expected ranges or had expected/valid values. Text attribute values were checked for spelling and usage consistency. No topology tests were conducted. All records were verified to occur within the spatial domain of the feature class/shapefile.</logic>

<procstep>
<procdesc>Authoritative data sources are identified through open source research. That data is then acquired and transformed into a usable data format. The properly formatted data then goes through preprocessing steps that includes a geocoding operation to give spatial context to the data. The data goes through further refinement using remote sensing techniques. After preprocessing, every record goes through a review process and each point is moved to a facility based on-entity location based on interpretation of the best available imagery and open source information. Colleges and Universities that are part of a multi-building campus were located on a large building towards the center of campus. The VAL_DATE field indicates the date in which the review step took place.</procdesc>

<eaover>The entity and attribute information provided here describes the tabular data associated with the data set. Please review the detailed descriptions that are provided (the individual attribute descriptions) for information on the values that appear as fields/table entries of the data set. Please see the “Processing Steps” section for further methodology.  For string and date data types, NOT AVAILABLE values denote missing data that was not present in the source data. For numeric data types, -999 denotes missing data that was not present in the source data.  However, the missing data may be present in other sources not yet discovered and used in the creation and/or maintenance of this dataset. These records may be populated with valid information in future update cycles. For fields sourced to NCES IPEDS, -2 indicates that a value for that record is 'Not applicable'.</eaover>
