# Exercise 2

With your own research or pedagogical needs in mind, consider the type of question(s) you can ask or arguments you might make with a spatial visualization. Reflect on these and other questions while drawing or sketching out a dataset, map, or other visualization.

- What type of map would help you answer this question?
- How could you use spatial visualization in a class setting?
- What type of data source(s) would you need? 
- Would you create your own data or require an existing dataset?
- What kind of resources might you need access to?
