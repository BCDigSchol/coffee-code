# Teaching through Annotation with Hypothes.is

# Introduction

This session explores web annotation as a strategy for teaching and learning. You will be introduced to [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is), which allows individuals and groups to publicly or privately discuss any web pageâ€”from the popular press to literary works and scholarly journal articles. By creating annotations and participating in interpretive conversations, students develop traditional close reading skills, as well as newer forms of digital and media literacy.

Navigate to this lesson plan at [bit.ly/bcannotates](http://bit.ly/bcannotates).

## Learning Goals

Participants will:

- practice creating annotations using [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is)
- articulate specific strategies for using [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is) in the classroom

    - Public
    - Private to [Coffee & Code](https://hypothes.is/groups/oBmJ6bz8/coffee-code) group
    - Private to you ('Only me')
- Create a hypothes.is URL. From the [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is) home page, click on **Paste a Link**.
- View your [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is) profile. What annotations appear when you're logged in? When you're logged out?

### Using Hypothes.is in the Classroom

- What ideas do you have for using [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is) in the classroom?
- What kinds of sources might you have students annotate?
- What different learning goals might public annotations versus private group annotations support?
- What logistical challenges do you anticipate when designing assignments around [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is)?
