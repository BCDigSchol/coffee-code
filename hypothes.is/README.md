# Teaching through Annotation with Hypothes.is

# Introduction

This session explores web annotation as a strategy for teaching and learning. You will be introduced to Hypothes.is, which allows individuals and groups to publicly or privately discuss any web pageâ€”from the popular press to literary works and scholarly journal articles. By creating annotations and participating in interpretive conversations, students develop traditional close reading skills, as well as newer forms of digital and media literacy.

## Learning Goals

Participants will:

- practice creating annotations using Hypothes.is
- articulate specific strategies to use Hypothes.is in the classroom

## Workshop Outline

### Getting Started with Hypothes.is

1. If you don't already have one, [create a hypothes.is account](https://web.hypothes.is/start).
2. Join our [Coffee & Code hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/groups/oBmJ6bz8/coffee-code) group.
3. Create your first annotation! Let's start with [Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address](https://via.hypothes.is/https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8/1:711?rgn=div1;view=fulltext). Be sure to change the selected group from **Public** to **Coffee & Code**.
