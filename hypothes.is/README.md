# Teaching through Annotation with Hypothes.is

# Introduction

This session explores web annotation as a strategy for teaching and learning. You will be introduced to [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is), which allows individuals and groups to publicly or privately discuss any web pageâ€”from the popular press to literary works and scholarly journal articles. By creating annotations and participating in interpretive conversations, students develop traditional close reading skills, as well as newer forms of digital and media literacy.

## Learning Goals

Participants will:

- practice creating annotations using Hypothes.is
- articulate specific strategies to use Hypothes.is in the classroom

## Workshop Outline

### Getting Started with Hypothes.is

- If you don't already have one, [create an account](https://web.hypothes.is/start), and install the add-on for your preferred browser.
- Join our [Coffee & Code](https://hypothes.is/groups/oBmJ6bz8/coffee-code) group.
- Create annotations! Note that you can tag annotations.
    - Publicly visible web page: [Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address](https://via.hypothes.is/https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8/1:711?rgn=div1;view=fulltext)
    - Article behind a paywall: [Shakespeare's Influence on Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address](http://proxy.bc.edu/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com.proxy.bc.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&sw=w&u=mlin_m_bostcoll&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA79828718&asid=156611030d64502b1593d34a34a94eb7)
    - Google doc that has been "published to the web"
    - PDF
- Change the visibility of your annotations:
    - Public
    - Private to [Coffee & Code](https://hypothes.is/groups/oBmJ6bz8/coffee-code) group
    - Private to you ('Only me')
- Create a hypothes.is URL. From the [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is) home, click on **Paste a Link**.
- View your hypothes.is profile. When I'm logged in, [my profile](https://hypothes.is/users/ararebit) displays all of my annotations. When I'm not logged in, my profile only displays public annotations.

### Using Hypothes.is in the Classroom

- What ideas do you have for using hypothes.is in the classroom?
- What kinds of sources might you have students annotate?
- What are the pros and cons of public annotations versus private group annotations? What different learning goals might these different strategies support?
