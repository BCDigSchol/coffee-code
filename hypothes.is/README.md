# Teaching through Annotation with Hypothes.is

# Introduction

This session explores web annotation as a strategy for teaching and learning. You will be introduced to Hypothes.is, which allows individuals and groups to publicly or privately discuss any web pageâ€”from the popular press to literary works and scholarly journal articles. By creating annotations and participating in interpretive conversations, students develop traditional close reading skills, as well as newer forms of digital and media literacy.

## Learning Goals

Participants will:

- practice creating annotations using Hypothes.is
- articulate specific strategies to use Hypothes.is in the classroom

## Workshop Outline

### Getting Started with Hypothes.is

- If you don't already have one, [create a hypothes.is account](https://web.hypothes.is/start), and install the add-on for your preferred browser.
- Join our [Coffee & Code hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/groups/oBmJ6bz8/coffee-code) group. During this workshop, we'll create annotations within this group.
- Create your first annotation! Let's start with a publicly visible web page, [Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address](https://via.hypothes.is/https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8/1:711?rgn=div1;view=fulltext). By default, your annotation will be **Public**, but if you'd like, you can limit the visibility of your annotation to our **Coffee & Code** group.
- Change the visibility of your annotation from either **Public** or **Coffee & Code** to **Only Me**.
- Create an annotation on an article behind a paywall.
- Create an annotation of a Google doc that has been "published to the web."
- Create a hypothes.is URL. From the [Hypothes.is home page](https://web.hypothes.is), click on **Paste a Link**, and paste a link to a resource you would like to annotate.
- View your hypothes.is profile. When I'm logged in, [my hypothes.is profile](https://hypothes.is/users/ararebit) displays all of my annotations: public, private to me, and private to a group. When I'm not logged in, the only annotations that display are those I've chosen to make completely public.

### Using Hypothes.is in the Classroom

- What ideas do you have for using hypothes.is in the classroom?
- What kinds of sources might you have students annotate?
- What are the pros and cons of public annotations versus private group annotations? What different learning goals might these different strategies support?
